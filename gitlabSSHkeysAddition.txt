Git client needs to be connected with the remote platform (Gitlab in this case)
You need to authenticate to gitlab before running git commands
Your public SSH key must be added to the remote platform
Steps : 
1) Go to gitlab
2) Go to settings (preferences)
3) Select SSH keys from the left panel
   Note : Paste you public SSH key, which is usually contained in the file '~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub' or '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub' and begins with 'ssh-ed25519' or 'ssh-rsa'. Do not paste your private SSH key, as that can compromise your identity.
